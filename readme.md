**Problem Statement:**
GRAPH FOR BETTER HEALTH
Find Novel Drug Treatments

**Description**: 


The aim of our project is to provide drug repurposing using graph and machine learning. 
Drug repurposing  is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. Given the high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace of new drug discovery and development, repurposing of 'old' drugs to treat both common and rare diseases is increasingly becoming an attractive proposition because it involves the use of de-risked compounds, with potentially lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines. Various data-driven and experimental approaches have been suggested for the identification of repurposable drug candidates.
In order to obtain high accuracy in these studies, large and comprehensive data should be used. We used the DRKG dataset in this project.This dataset contains more than 5.8 million data, which is kept as a graph, and therefore, a database that can perform fast processing and is suitable for machine learning projects is needed. TigerGraph is very suitable for these purposes.


Our project is the most Impactful in solving a real world problem  on solving drug repurposing in the healthcare industry.Our project lists new drugs that are highly likely to be used directly for the diseases in the dataset. It is known that drugs can also affect other diseases apart from their current use. The drugs we predict are the drugs that have been used for other diseases and have the highest probability of affecting the selected disease.
